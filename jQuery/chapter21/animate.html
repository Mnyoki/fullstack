        <p>the journey has been too scary towards accomplishment. i see changes all along. I can do something on the web but my deamons still shouting. "broo wake. still you are shit. you suck</p>

        <p>lots of voices trying to tell me to stop and look for something else. I have neve done any serious coding but information is power. the you be infomed the more courageous you become. </p>

        <p>If it makes sences to you stick to it. lot of cowards around trying to tell what i can do and what i can't. Broo first fix your shit. </p>
    </div>
