<p>Sometimes the brain want to do while the body is in fight mode and vice verse. We daily strive for the best version of our own isolating the bad vibes. You only have one life to live and you have the choice to live it how you dime want.</p>

    <h1>The stuggle</h1>
    <p>Crazy word with crazy people. We have to be by us all time as we grow. If you are from where am from, you have to keep everything to yourself for to to survive the harsh world. Nothing close to like minded people but hoping soon to find one of my species.</p>
    <p><h2>How does it feel being you?</h2><br>Being me is weird and strange. i dont have a full description of how it feel being me. I get possesed with anything thats constructive and am doing it. I fucking love nature and am kind to everyone.<br>I fucking hate what people love. I love minding my own businness and working toward my best version.</p>
