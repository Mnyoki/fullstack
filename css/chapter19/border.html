    <h1>Becoming a developer</h1>
    <p>Web is such an awesome piece of art that we bring ideas into reality and you can make things real, real depending on your skill set.</p>
    <p><br>I have come to realize that self teachingyourself aint that hard. you just have to chanel some good amount of work and energy for you to succumb all ghosts and demons that are way right behind.</p><br>
    <p>You have to constantly learn how to motivate your damn self because self teaching has no grades and if you try grading yourself, most of the time, it would be to your favor.</p><br>
    <p>I doubt if there are other patient beings than self taught developers. Those guys have avery strong will power. They fight everything to fit into their space.<br><br> <strong>Letme out it like this:</strong> Programming needs time and patiency coz you trying to master the syntax, rythm and hacks all at once. Do you remember the tossoles</p><br>

        <h1>The price!</h1>
        <p>They say <em>repetition is the mother of skill</em> and if you want something great you have to be great. Learning how to code too revolutionises you too. There traits will start to show up and others fade. ever in constant brain battles. If you know your end game, then you will have the wills to peservier</p>

        <br><h1>Farry tales</h1>
        <p>Just like all enthusised newbee exploring my carrer choise and since i had just received my calling letter to a local collage, I had to worder of all posible choices i had right ahead and commit to one of them. You can't be a master of all.</p><br>
        <p>I love Math hated computer but with a notion hate is just a feeling learned. i borded my ship and start my journey as a mathematics and computer science major. <strong>Puzzled</strong> Having two major? hell gone loss</p>

                <p>The beauty of the jungle relies mostly by the observer and the observer is one who pays for the participants. Just like in sport, the funs are the ones that carry whole the emotions while the game is on. <b>BE THE PLAYER.</b> Dont fall in the spectating phase . you either beat them or join them.</p>

                <h1>Believe</h1>
                <p>Soon after the syntax battle now came the battle that you have to moneytorize your skill. Direct from an "helo world!" to writting complex algorithims and events. The nights became darker, all i knew was my small bubble of copying pasting every piece of code that seemed cool and workable. Had to come up with some new stratergies. </p>

            <p>What do you think is the price of mastery? <em>We tend to get in a procrastination phase pretending to really know what's going on. </em> Atleast you have hope and thats a good sign.</p>
            <br><p>Hope is vital and essential. Keep going.</p><br>
            <p>They said <em>Fake it till you make it.</em> It will once have some meaning</p>
