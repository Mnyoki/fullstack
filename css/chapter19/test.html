        <h1>Turning point</h1>
        <p>I geuss intracommunication is one strong tool that only the strong of heart and will can toralet. To my thought i wondered what i was doing about me or its gonna be loots of weed with some shitty company. I was advanteged to be at one on the local colages so my scope was alittle bit broad <em>New environments new feelings</em><br>
        I had some experience with some manual shitty low waged jobs. I tabled everything from being a masonry to being a CTO. Mam took the best of my desicion. Her effort couldn't be in vein. Manual jobs became terminated from the equition.<br>I knew nothing about tech and there was my last fallback or foward. Just some little romous about bitcoin and wordpress. <br>Bitcoin implementation became way wide my reach. Web Development came to light since CMS's wasn't my thing. I wanted something challenging, something that gives me gouse bumps whenever it comes to the picture.</p>

        <h1>Plan</h1>
        <p>Plans were not my thing so i suffocated my little thinking brain with lots of roadmaps and some toxic tutorial atleast to satisfy my feeling brain.<br>Big up to tutors like <i>Travesy Media</i> and <i>Clever Programmer</i>. This guy became my closest buddies. They really filled my feeling brain.<br>January to December started being too small, little cracks started to build up. Time became of essence.</p>
