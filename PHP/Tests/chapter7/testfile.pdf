the progress is amaizing. the struggles are real. if there is nothing you can do about the situation, why grief?
its best to not worry about what you can't solve. 

have been trying to be a good persons but it high time i incoporate a budget and a plan in everything i do cos i can't be this broke. i need to account for every penny i use.
dealing with file system is fun untill google isn't around then you know you fucked up.

i love my me time . i am all alone at this struggles and i know am capable of getting the best in it .

accept the learning curve and the changes that comes with it.

thanks
