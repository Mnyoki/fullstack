  BASIC SYNTAX.
    1. semicolon
       -used to show end of a line ( a line break).
         ie: 
	     $number = 10;
    2. The $ sybol.
        - Used to initialize a charecter (initilizer of a character)
	 ie:
	     $firstName = "Moses";
	     $lastName = "Munyoki";
	     $myArray = ("john", "doe");
	     $sum = 10 + 2;

    3. Variable
         - Are values assigned to the initialized character.
	 ie:
	     $userName = "admin";
	     echo $userName;
	     $currentUser = $userName

     4. Arrays.
         - a set of date stored as group.
	 ie:
	     $myArray = array("john", "doe", "graham", "delta");

	   a. two dimentional array.
	   b. multi dimentional array.

	       ie:
	           -$OXO = array(array("O", "X", "O"),
		                 array("X", "O", "X"),
				 array("X", "O", "x"));
				 echo $OXO[1][2];
     5. Variable-naming rules.
        a. Variable names after the dollar sign must start with a letter of the alphabet or _underscore character.
	b. Variable names can contain only the charactersa-z,A-Z,0-9, and _.
	c. Variable names ma not contain spaces. if a variable name must comprise more than one word, a good idea is to separate the words with the underscore (_) character 
	  ie: user_name;
	d. Variable names are case sensitive.

     6. Operators
       - Lets you perform mathematical operations, string comparison and logic oparation.
       - You generally use a logic operator to combine the results of two of the comparison operators
   
     7. Variable Assignment.
       - ie:
           $variable = value;
	   $other_variable = $variable;

     8. String concatenation.
       - Arcane term for putting something after another thing (joining).
       - It uses a period to append one string after another thing.
     9. String types.
       - " " - Incluides the value of a variable inside a string
       - ' ' - Assigns a literal string preserving the exact contents.

     10 Escaping characters.
       - These are characters used in defining built in character to laimans with the use of a back-slash (\).
       ie: 
         \n, \", \'.

      11. Constants.
         - Variable that are user and system defined and are not altered.
	 ie: 
	   define("ROOT_LOCATION", "/usr/local/www/");

	   -Reading the contents of the variable.
	   $directory = ROOT_LOCATION;

	   NB// The main two things you have to remember about constants are that they must not be prefaced with a $(unlike regular variables), and that you can define them only using the define function.


      12. Predefined Constants.
         - System defined constants.
	 ie: 
	    __LINE__, __DIR__, __FILE__, __NAMESPACE__
