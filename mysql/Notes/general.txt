# Normalization - The process of separating your data into tables and creating primary key (avoid duplicates).
    
    keys - Makes search faster.
       # types
          1. First Normal form
             - There should be no repeating columns containing the same kind od data.
             - All columns should contain a single value.
             - There should be a primary key to uniquely identify each row
          2. Second
          3. Third
             - Is it likely that many new columns will need to be added to this able?
             - could any of this table's field require a global update at any point?

    NB// Normalization don't work on high traffic sites since it will cause MySQL to thrash.

    ## Relationships
    - MySQL is called a relational database managment system because its tables store not only data but the relationships among the data. 

        ### Type of relationships
          1. One-to-One
             - Each item has a relationship to only one item of the other type.
              - If two items have one-to-one relationship, you include them as columns in the same table bcoz:
                a. You want to be prepared in case the relationships changes later and is no longer one-to-one.
                b. The table has alot of columns, and you think that  perfomance and maintenance would improve by splitting it.
          2. One-to-many
             - Occurs when one row in one table is linked to many rows in another table.
          3. Many-to-Many
             - Many rows in one table are linked to many rows in another table.


# Databases and Anonymity.
# Transactions.
# Transaction Storage Engines.
    - To be able to use MySQL's transaction facility, you have to be using MySQL's InnoDB storage engine.
